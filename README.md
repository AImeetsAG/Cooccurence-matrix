# Cooccurence-matrix

This is a code written by me in Python that generates the [Co-occurence matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Co-occurrence_matrix) for a list of corpus documents. The novelty here is that the one can create a submatrix of consisting of the user specified number of words. This is important because generating the co-occurence matrix can take a long time if the corpus is large.\n

This is a NLP project.
