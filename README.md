# Cooccurence-matrix

This is a code written by me in Python that generates the [Co-occurence matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Co-occurrence_matrix) for a list of corpus documents. 

The novelty here is that the user can create a submatrix of consisting of the user specified number of words, and at the same time select words that should necessarily appear appear in the submatrix. This is important because generating the co-occurence matrix can take a long time if the corpus is large.

This is a NLP project.
